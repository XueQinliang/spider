Let's how what's the power of data science for my beloved sport. \n\nOne thing I notice while I am watching marathons on TV is that, there is usually projected finished time at the bottom. Of course, this is only for the elites. Nowadays, you can also track almost all the runner through live tracking, with the chip attached to each runner. When the runner pass one of the timing mats along the course, their times will be sent to the tracking server, and naturally, one can predict their projected finish time. The power we have here is that, we have more information about the individual runner, such as nationality, and I think this is the goal of this exercise - using the intermediate time plus these extra information, to build a better predictor.\n\n# Data inspection and cleaning\n## - Runner information\nFirstly, I will load the training data, and take a peek of the structure."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19db1d07-f811-c4d2-5c72-751c71ffe241"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)import re\nimport fnmatch    # for later text matching\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt    # for plotting\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('../input/challenge.csv')\nprint(train_df.shape)\ntrain_df.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"db5af5bf-71c2-a321-01c1-0088db738c99"},"source":"There are 5616 rows and 11 columns, where the last 3 columns are the 10 km, half way (21km) and 30 km time.
