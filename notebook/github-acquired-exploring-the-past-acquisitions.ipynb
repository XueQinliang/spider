It will be interesting to see how this acquisition goes in future years. Given all this buzz on social media, I thought it¡¯d be interesting to explore and visualize the data on acquisitions by the top seven companies since past four decadaes. I collated the dataset of acquisitions by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google/Alphabet, IBM, Yahoo and Microsoft.  The attributes in the dataset includes the date, year, month of the acquisition, name of the company acquired, value or the cost of acquisition, business use-case of the acquisition, and the country from which the acquisition was made. In this notebook, I have explored this dataset and visualized all the past acquisitions by these companies.  \n\nDataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/company-acquisitions-7-top-companies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### <a>Contents</a> <br>  <br>  \n\n\n<a href=\"#1\">1.
