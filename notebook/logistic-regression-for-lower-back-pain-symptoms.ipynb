But we haven't known what is w and b values, yet. We need to find weight values for each Col1, Col2,...,Col12 and a single bias value. \nFor this dataset, our w matrix will have 12 values. Then we will multiply x_train matrix with transpose of w matrix and then add bias value. The result would have no meaning at this point, so we apply sigmoid function to find a y_head value. Sigmoid function gives the result a probabilistic value between 0 and 1. At first try, the result would be so wrong because we don't know what should be optimal w and b values.  \nThen, according to y_head and y_train values, we will calculate the loss and cost of this iteration. At first iteration, cost would be so high because the result is wrong. We need to minimize the cost in order to find the optimal w and b values.\n\nNow, let's start one by one:\n\nFor first iteration, we need to assign some values to w and b. Generally, initial values are given as 0.0 for b and 0.01 for w. w must be a matrix that has a size of 12(column number of x_train) for our data set.

Then we need to calculate the loss and cost of our iteration.\n\nFormulas of loss and cost functions are like below.\n\nIn loss formula, y would be our y_train matrix and y_head would be the result of logistic regression formula that we find.\n<figure>\n    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1eTEGZtUR2hA40ynqjqGzXKZMeklDvEeE' \n         style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%; height: auto\"\n         alt='missing'/>\n</figure>\n\nIn cost formula, we sum total loss that we find according the formula above, then we divide the result to sample size, which is 248 for our data set.\n<figure>\n    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1b-JNQntWBivulojfCX26ROV3rcfozcNB' \n         style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%; height: auto\"\n         alt='missing'/>\n</figure>\n\nAll this process; finding y_head and then calculating loss and cost is called forward propagation. Now it is time to go backward and find new w and b values that gives a lower cost. This is called backpropagation. With doing lots of forward-backward propogations, we try to find the minimum cost and w and b values that gives minimum cost.\n\nIn order to go backward, Gradient Descent formula can be used.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zOLAAnYuc9XWG9DpeA1njTtPBkIxrA5S' \n         style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%; height: auto\"\n         alt='missing'/>\n</figure>\n\n\nAccording to graph above, we started with an initial w value. This w value has a slope over the curve bigger than 0. We need to change w and b values step by step and try to find minimum cost which is shown as red circle. How to undertstand that we find minimum cost? At minimum cost, if we draw a line like red line shown on the graph, the slope between red line and curve will be 0 because red line is parallel to x-axis. This means that we need to continue iterations until we find slope is 0 or nearly 0. This technique is called Gradient Descent.\n\nAt every iteration, we go backward, update w and b, then calculate loss and cost. Update function of both w and b are like below. There is also another variable named as alpha in the equation, which is actually leraning rate. Learning rate value will be given manually. This value is how fast or how slow should our algorithm makes every iterations. We should not give very high or very low values, we will try to find the optimal value later.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OK7hNodJKNernY2m4iw7DnV0EHKBEbMV' \n         style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%; height: auto\"\n         alt='missing'/>\n</figure>\n\nAs you can see in update formula, we need to calculate derivatives of w and b according to loss function. Derivative formulas for w and b are like below. X is our x_train matrix, Y is our y_train matrix and g(X) is our y_head matrix. m is the sample number which is 248 for our data set and can be found as x_train.shape[1].\n\n<figure>\n    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1p0_C-Q-Su9eXo38pgauBxrOTMx64NvnB' \n         style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%; height: auto\"\n         alt='missing'/>\n</figure>\n\nLet's write a function that calculates y_head, loss and cost values as forward propagation, and calculates derivatives of w and b as backpropagation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"78fe16cf69c87233bda5b458dced2fa9afcf6b15"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def forward_backward_propagation(w,b,x_train,y_train):\n    # forward propagation\n    \n    y_head = sigmoid(np.dot(w.T,x_train) + b)\n    loss = -(y_train*np.log(y_head) + (1-y_train)*np.log(1-y_head))\n    cost = np.sum(loss) / x_train.shape[1]\n    \n    # backward propagation\n    derivative_weight = np.dot(x_train,((y_head-y_train).T))/x_train.shape[1]\n    derivative_bias = np.sum(y_head-y_train)/x_train.shape[1]\n    gradients = {\"derivative_weight\" : derivative_weight, \"derivative_bias\" : derivative_bias}\n    \n    return cost,gradients","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7f7c0a02a47c07f0c57b3ef3adc4893169b9871a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Forward_backward_propagation function calculates derivatives once.
