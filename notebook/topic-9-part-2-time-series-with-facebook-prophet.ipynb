Introduction\n\nAccording to the [article](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/) on Facebook Research, Prophet was initially developed for the purpose of creating high quality business forecasts. This library tries to address the following difficulties common to many business time series:\n- Seasonal effects caused by human behavior: weekly, monthly and yearly cycles, dips and peaks on public holidays.\n- Changes in trend due to new products and market events.\n- Outliers.\n\nThe authors claim that, even with the default settings, in many cases, their library produces forecasts as accurate as those delivered by experienced analysts.\n\nMoreover, Prophet has a number of intuitive and easily interpretable customizations that allow gradually improving the quality of the forecasting model. What is especially important, these paramaters are quite comprehensible even for non-experts in time series analysis, which is a field of data science requiring certain skill and experience.\n\nBy the way, the original article is called \"Forecasting at Scale\", but it is not about the scale in the \"usual\" sense, that is addressing computational and infrastructure problems of a large number of working programs. According to the authors, Prophet should scale well in the following 3 areas:\n- Accessibility to a wide audience of analysts, possibly without profound expertise in time series.\n- Applicability to a wide range of distinct forecasting problems.\n- Automated performance estimation of a large number of forecasts including flagging of potential problems for their subsequent inspection by the analyst."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7802a24b4448477f4cc69e537fc918847e63387c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. The Prophet Forecasting Model\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at how Prophet works. In its essence, this library utilizes the [additive regression model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_model) $y(t)$ comprising the following components:\n\n$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \\epsilon_{t},$$\n\nwhere:\n* Trend $g(t)$ models non-periodic changes.\n* Seasonality $s(t)$ represents periodic changes.\n* Holidays component $h(t)$ contributes information about holidays and events.\n\nBelow, we will consider some important properties of these model components."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9370c9a96f07a9186b89c7423d17383a5d373a40"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Trend\n\nThe Prophet library implements two possible trend models for $g(t)$.\n\nThe first one is called *Nonlinear, Saturating Growth*. It is represented in the form of the [logistic growth model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function):\n\n$$g(t) = \\frac{C}{1+e^{-k(t - m)}},$$\n\nwhere:\n* $C$ is the carrying capacity (that is the curve's maximum value).\n* $k$ is the growth rate (which represents \"the steepness\" of the curve).\n* $m$ is an offset parameter.\n\nThis logistic equation allows modelling non-linear growth with saturation, that is when the growth rate of a value decreases with its growth. One of the typical examples would be representing the growth of the audience of an application or a website.\n\nActually, $C$ and $k$ are not necessarily constants and may vary over time. Prophet supports both automatic and manual tuning of their variability. The library can itself choose optimal points of trend changes by fitting the supplied historical data. \n\nAlso, Prophet allows analysts to manually set changepoints of the growth rate and capacity values at different points in time. For instance, analysts may have insights about dates of past releases that prominently influenced some key product indicators.\n\nThe second trend model is a simple *Piecewise Linear Model* with a constant rate of growth. It is best suited for problems without saturating growth."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0f53b585ab18cf85a709dc3f27dc10b412560a69"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Seasonality\n\nThe seasonal component $s(t)$ provides a flexible model of periodic changes due to weekly and yearly seasonality.\n\nWeekly seasonal data is modeled with dummy variables. Six new variables are added: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, which take values 0 or 1 depending on the day of the week. The feature `sunday` is not added because it would be a linear combination of the other days of the week, and this fact would have an adverse effect on the model.\n\nYearly seasonality model in Prophet relies on Fourier series.\n\nSince [version 0.2](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) you can also use *sub-daily time series* and make *sub-daily forecasts* as well as employ the new *daily seasonality* feature."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d5fa7273168f7fc9c5775c09ca23739d345ff0b9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Holidays and Events\n\nThe component $h(t)$ represents predictable abnormal days of the year including those on irregular schedules, e.g., Black Fridays.\n\nTo utilize this feature, the analyst needs to provide a custom list of events."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3f1e4536d60790db9952d80af545f98cf974837c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Error\n\nThe error term $\\epsilon(t)$ represents information that was not reflected in the model.

Taylor and Benjamin Letham.\n\nThe authors also compared their library with several other methods for time series forecasting. They used [Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) as a measure of prediction accuracy. In this research, Prophet has shown substantially lower forecasting error than the other models."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"27a9e0f517fe2b121ebf97d92dc3412f66d9a10e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/cx/no/7lcxnoboz_ubpwuoq5bxcxd_toa.png>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"980b12982a124cdecfa2c8e73c9c2d56842a8468"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look closer at how the forcasting quality was measured in the article. To do this, we will need the formula of Mean Absolute Percentage Error.\n\nLet $y_{i}$ be the *actual (historical) value* and $\\hat{y}_{i}$ be the *forecast value* given by our model.\n\nThen $e_{i} = y_{i} - \\hat{y}_{i}$ is the *forecast error* and $p_{i} =\\frac{\\displaystyle e_{i}}{\\displaystyle y_{i}}$ is the *relative forecast error*.\n\nWe define\n\n$$MAPE = mean\\big(\\left |p_{i} \\right |\\big)$$\n\nMAPE is widely used as a measure of prediction accuracy because it expresses error as a percentage and thus can be used in model evaluations on different datasets.\n\nIn addition, when evaluating a forecasting algorithm, it may prove useful to calculate [MAE (Mean Absolute Error)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) in order to have a picture of errors in absolute numbers. Using previously defined components, its equation will be\n\n$$MAE = mean\\big(\\left |e_{i}\\right |\\big)$$"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b77241e6b52d51eaaa087e22100e97add98e9246"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A few words about the algorithms that Prophet was compared with. Most of them are quite simple and often are used as a baseline for other models:\n* `naive` is a simplistic forecasting approach where we predict all future values relying solely on the observation at the last available point of time.\n* `snaive` (seasonal naive) is a model that makes constant predictions taking into account information about seasonality. For instance, in the case of weekly seasonal data for each future Monday, we would predict the value from the last Monday, and for all future Tuesdays we would use the value from the last Tuesday and so on.\n* `mean` uses the averaged value of data as a forecast.\n* `arima` stands for *Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average*, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) for details.\n* `ets` stands for *Exponential Smoothing*, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) for more."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"980ad6ccf8671b45897bb37798ef31ad043ca58f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

Let's see where it will lead us.\n\nA few words about this transformation. This is a monotonic data transformation that can be used to stabilize variance. We will use the one-parameter Box每Cox transformation, which is defined by the following expression:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n  boxcox^{(\\lambda)}(y_{i}) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{\\displaystyle y_{i}^{\\lambda} - 1}{\\displaystyle \\lambda} &, \\text{if $\\lambda \\neq 0$}.\\\\\n    ln(y_{i}) &, \\text{if $\\lambda = 0$}.\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nWe will need to implement the inverse of this function in order to be able to restore the original data scale. It is easy to see that the inverse is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n  invboxcox^{(\\lambda)}(y_{i}) = \\begin{cases}\n    e^{\\left (\\frac{\\displaystyle ln(\\lambda y_{i} + 1)}{\\displaystyle \\lambda} \\right )} &, \\text{if $\\lambda \\neq 0$}.\\\\\n    e^{y_{i}} &, \\text{if $\\lambda = 0$}.\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding function in Python is implemented as follows:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"39ce1961844a28e5fecf0b75a794bbfb3d1a65a3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def inverse_boxcox(y, lambda_):\n    return np.exp(y) if lambda_ == 0 else np.exp(np.log(lambda_ * y + 1) / lambda_)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2ce4e69c6437ef7bb9f5be8879531691efe0942b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we prepare our dataset by setting its index:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c27fd56eb35f757313a6414e4d27fc9b76c57948"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df2 = train_df.copy().set_index('ds')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7fc13b9a722e9343864f26e5d0ebfc5a75c7147a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then, we apply the function `stats.boxcox` from `Scipy`, which applies the Box每Cox transformation.
