It is important to consider when the question is being asked. Most frequently this is asked before the match starts, but it could also be asked after the match has be running for 10 or 15 minutes. It could be asked before hero selection, and all that is known is the identity of the competitors. It could also be asked after hero selection in which case the hero composition of each team would be something to consider. An additional case to consider would be predicting the outcome based only on the heros involved not accounting for the players identities. \n\nThe important point is that a time and set of conditions need to be picked before trying to solve the problem. Here we will try to predict the outcome of a match when only the player identities are known, but before hero selection or any gameplay starts.\n\nAny information only available after we ask the question is off limits. This means any details at all about events in the match should be excluded as well as any information about future matches."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ffe0476b-7ed5-8713-e188-719f558663d8"},"outputs":[],"source":"# take a look at the match data\nmatches.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b7420cb5-c9c8-cfb7-c516-87f36d021083"},"source":"Of these variables only game_mode, cluster, and perhaps start_time are possible to determine before the match starts.

It is pretty easy to see that a time based split is probably best here for validation. By holding out future we reduce the likelyhood of accidently introducing leakage.
