A few alternatives I came accross are:\n1. Use [mean LotFrontage of the neighbourhood](https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard) \n2. Use [mean LotFrontage of entire set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/discussion/50085)\n3. Simply [fill all missing values with zero](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/discussion/50085)\n\nI will benchmark _LotFrontage_ prediction error against these approaches to make sure there  is a noticeable improvement.

There are a few key features that I suspect will influence LotFrontage:\n* _LotArea_ - Clearly should have a significant correlation with LotFrontage. This relationship would not be linear, but some 2nd degree polynomial. If all lots were exactly square, then ${LotFrontage} = \\sqrt{LotArea}$ and we'd be done :)\n* _LotConfig_ - Corner unit will likely have a larger LotFrontage than Inside lots. Similarly, CulDSac will have a circular shape of its LotFrontage.\n* _LotShape_ - Regular and irregular lots likely have different relationships between LotFrontage and LotArea.\n* _Alley_ - This may indicate, along with other variables, the geometry of the lot (e.g. garage facing the alley, will not influence Lot Frontage)\n* _MSZoning_ - High and low density residentials zones may have different LotFrontage values.\n* _BldgType_ - Townhouse has a much more narrow footprint than a detached house. This should affect LotFrontage quite a bit.\n* _Neighborhood_ - Different parts of the city may have different standard for LotArea and LotFrontage.\n* _Condition1_ & _Condition2_ - Can serve as markers for lot location within the neighbourhood (e.g. lots within same block are similar in size and LotFrontage)\n* _GarageType_ - Garage must have direct access to street, which should influence LotFrontage. Unless of course the garage is facing the alley.\n* _GarageCars_ - Number of cars that fit in the garage will also affect the Lot Frontage, similar to GarageType.\n\nBefore we dive into exploring the relationships between these and the _LotFrontage_ target variable, I'll define a quick and dirty outlier detection function to remove noice from the visualizations."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0d865ebaa0ad6f9396005cf5f78f5078b19fab35"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def idOutliers (dat):\n    tile25 = dat.describe()[4]\n    tile75 = dat.describe()[6]\n    iqr = tile75 - tile25 \n    out = (dat > tile75+1.5*iqr) | (dat < tile25-1.5*iqr)\n    return out","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e1371e8664b39d144e2584e83e08f3f232948376"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's start by looking at _LotArea_ and its relation to _LotFrontage_.
