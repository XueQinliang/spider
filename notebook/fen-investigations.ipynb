The problem that this string `8/1R6/k7/6QK/q2b4/8/3n4/8 w` is not really helpful for ML purposes. Also if you will notice, my position is not really a FEN position. There is no information about castling, el-passant and the number of moves. I removed them because there are no pawns in racing kings and there is also no castling.\n\nI have not found any reasonable library to nicely visualize the notation, so I use lichess to take a look. Just go to [this page][2] and insert your position. You will get something [like this][3]:\n\n![enter image description here][4]\n\nYou can also evaluate this position, but keep in mind that the score on lichess is from -10 to 10 and also includes values like mate in X moves. In my dataset all the values are from -1 to 1.\n\n\n----------\n\nIn many positions you can see that the score of the position is very different depending on whose move it is (`w` or `b` at the end of the string). In my opinion it is easier to build two models: one to evaluate for black and another for white. Here is a function that does that (I use Python 2)\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation\n  [2]: https://en.lichess.org/analysis/racingKings/\n  [3]: https://en.lichess.org/analysis/racingKings/8/1R6/k7/6QK/q2b4/8/3n4/8_w\n  [4]: https://s15.postimg.org/43caj16uz/chess.png"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a60f64d0-5da3-2309-7b78-771fd37e16c4"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_data(file_path, is_white):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of FENs and np.array of scores for all positions where is_white is to move.\n    FENs are without `w` or `b` at the end\n    \n    Args:\n        file_path  - location of a csv file\n        is_white   - whether white is to move from this position\n    \"\"\"\n    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    data['fen_modified'] = data['fen'].str.split().str.get(0)\n    data['is_white'] = data['fen'].str.split().str.get(1) == 'w'\n    \n    if is_white:\n        res = data[data['is_white']][['fen_modified', 'score', 'is_white']]\n    else:\n        res = data[~data['is_white']][['fen_modified', 'score', 'is_white']]\n        \n    return res['fen_modified'].tolist(), res['score'].as_matrix()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f7fc5398-e827-8677-22e8-7f4e75dce5fb"},"source":"My approach is to transform a FEN position into something that can be used with ML algorithms:\n\n - 64 dimensional vectors of numbers\n - 8x8 dimensional matrix\n - 8x8x11 tensor, 11 is the number of different pieces\n\nHere is a couple of functions that I created to transform a list of modified FENs (without `w` or `b` at the end) to different representations."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"177ddb24-c90f-d302-d2a9-eccab1f50e4b"},"outputs":[],"source":"def map_values():\n    # maps pieces from FEN to a specific value\n    return {\n        'K': 5,   'k': -5,\n        'Q': 4,   'q': -4,\n        'R': 3,   'r': -3,\n        'B': 2,   'b': -2,\n        'N': 1,   'n': -1,\n        '0': 0\n    }\n\ndef map_vectors():\n    # maps pieces from FEN to a specific vector\n    return {\n        'K': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        'Q': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], \n        'R': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        'B': [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        'N': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        'k': [-1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        'q': [0, -1, 0, 0, 0],\n        'r': [0, 0, -1, 0, 0],\n        'b': [0, 0, 0, -1, 0],\n        'n': [0, 0, 0, 0, -1],\n        '0': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    }\n\ndef fens2tensor(fens_arr, piece_map, is_reshape):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a list of fens into a tensor, ready to be fed into a ML algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        fens_arr   - array of fens without w/b: '8/3n4/5Q2/q2r1N2/2k2K2/3N4/3R4/8'\n        piece_map  - a dictionary that maps each of the pieces to some value.
