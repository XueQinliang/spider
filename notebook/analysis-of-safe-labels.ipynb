All training files in the originally dataset have been accounted for.\n  1. All training files originally labeled as `preictal` (class 1) are safe to use to train solutions.\n  1. Quite a few training files originally labeled as `interictal` are now labelled `unsafe` and should not be used. For example, for patient 1, 582 of the original `interictal` training files should be discarded. The remaining 570 files can continue to be used. (The number of training files in the original dataset is 1152 which equals 582 + 570, so all are accounted for.)\n  1. Several of the test files in the original dataset are now labeled as `preictal` and `safe` and so presumably could be used as training data for new solutions.\n  1. One might assume that any file from the original test set that is _not_ labeled `safe` and `preictal` is `interictal`. However, this has not been specifically stated. In any case, no `safe` labels are provided for those files. Some competitors have discovered experimentally that some of them are `unsafe`. So these files cannot safely be used to train solutions, based on the information provided."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
