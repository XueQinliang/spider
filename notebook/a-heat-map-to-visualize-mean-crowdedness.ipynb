You have to wait to use equipment, the gym is loud, and might smell bad.  Its a good guess that early morning is a good time to go, but if you're like me, you can't get up that early.\n\nWhat if we could visualize what times and days were the busiest?  We can.  The data is in seconds after the start of the day, so let's convert that to hours.
