If he misses, the opposite happens, and he gets closer to the hoop.  This can be explained by the \"Hot Hand\" theory - it is possible that his performance actually improves. it even sounds reasonable. however, Selfish Gene showed this is not the case - the hand stays cold (or normal body surface temperature at most), regardless of the previous shot outcome.\n\nInspired by this really great script, I was curios to see whether this effect can be seen in the general population of NBA Players."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"50f896e2-1aa7-c47f-d20f-faea1c9a077b"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n# import data\nshots = pd.read_csv('../input/shot_logs.csv', header=0)\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"27ed641e-1f67-808f-d410-7cc773fc72c3"},"outputs":[],"source":"shots['previous'] = np.zeros(len(shots))\nshots['dist_diff'] = np.zeros(len(shots))\n\nfor i,row in enumerate(shots[1:].iterrows()):\n    if i>0:\n        if shots.loc[i,'GAME_ID'] == shots.loc[i-1,'GAME_ID']:\n            shots.loc[i,'previous'] = shots.loc[i-1,'SHOT_RESULT']\n            shots.loc[i,'dist_diff'] = shots.loc[i,'SHOT_DIST'] - shots.loc[i-1,'SHOT_DIST']\n            \n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ab1be32a-52af-6950-95d7-c205ed5de988"},"outputs":[],"source":"after_made = shots[shots.previous == 'made']\nafter_miss = shots[shots.previous =='missed']\n\nbins = np.arange(-30,30,0.5)\nx = after_made.dist_diff\ny = after_miss.dist_diff\n\nh1 = np.histogram(after_made.dist_diff,bins)\nh2 = np.histogram(after_miss.dist_diff,bins)\nhist_1 = np.true_divide(h1[0],sum(h1[0]))\nhist_2 = np.true_divide(h2[0],sum(h2[0]))\ncumu_1 = []\ncumu_1.append(0)\ncumu_2 = []\ncumu_2.append(0)\n\nfor i,item in enumerate(hist_1):\n    if i>0:\n        cumu_1.append(cumu_1[i-1] + hist_1[i])\n        cumu_2.append(cumu_2[i-1] + hist_2[i])\n        \n        \nplt.plot(bins[1:]*0.3,cumu_1)\nplt.plot(bins[1:]*0.3,cumu_2)\nplt.legend(['After made','After miss'], loc = 2)\nplt.xlabel('Difference from previous shot [m]')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Density Function')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f817e46e-5cea-8046-dda3-4ff5735b2b52"},"source":" Just like with Kobe, it seems that the average NBA Player gets closer to the basket after missing and the other way around after a successful attempt.\n\nBut again - can it simply be the actual effect of a hot hand?
