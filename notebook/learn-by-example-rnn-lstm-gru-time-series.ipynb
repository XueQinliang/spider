I did record my notes so it might help others in their journey to understand Neural Networks by examples (in this case using Recurring Networks stock predictions.) After seeing many youtube video's and various courses on Neural Networks found the Kaggle Keras course and examples helping me a lot to move from powerpoint understanding to run my own Neural Networks using Keras. Many thanks to this community! The least I could do is to contribute back, hence this notebook.  \n\nPlease watch this video about RNN/LSTM/GRU time series prediction, it gives you a good overview, it inspired me to reproduce the steps taken in this notebook:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2np77NOdnwk  \nThe code base:  \nhttps://github.com/jaungiers/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction  \nI would like to acknowledge this tutorial for providing ideas and code, learning by example:  \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/thebrownviking20/intro-to-recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-gru/notebook  \nIf you are new to Neural Networks you might want to have a look at my first notebook:  \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/charel/learn-neural-networks-by-example-mnist-digits
