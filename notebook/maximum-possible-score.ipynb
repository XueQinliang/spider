So in this notebook, let us do some computation for the same. \n\n**Objective:**\n\nWe have train data from 2015-01-28 to 2016-05-28 and the test data is from 2016-06-28.\n\nThe objective is to predict what **additional** products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what they already have at 2016-05-28. \n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nEvaluation metric is Mean Average Precision @ 7 (MAP@7) as seen from this [evaluation page][2].\n\nIf the number of added products for the given user at that time point is 0 (which is from May 2016 to June 2016), then the precision is defined to be 0.\n\n**Maximum possible score:**\n\nAll those customers who did not buy a product in the given one month will have a map@7 score of 0 though they will be counted in the mean calculation.  So the maximum possible score for the competition is not 1 and a value lesser than 1. We do not know the additional products bought in June 2016 to compute the maximum possible score for June.\n\nSo let us compute the maximum possible score for May 2016 by taking in to account what the customers already have in April 2016. This will get us a fairly good idea on the maximum possible score one would be able to achieve in this competition.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/leaderboard\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/details/evaluation"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"94e378cd-43d1-cb12-f855-f002622bec3c"},"outputs":[],"source":"# importing the modules needed #\nimport csv\nfrom operator import sub "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7cd71860-8496-4f01-47ec-c38e487aa45c"},"outputs":[],"source":"# name of the target columns #\ntarget_cols = ['ind_ahor_fin_ult1','ind_aval_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_cco_fin_ult1','ind_cder_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_cno_fin_ult1','ind_ctju_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_ctma_fin_ult1','ind_ctop_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_ctpp_fin_ult1','ind_deco_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_deme_fin_ult1','ind_dela_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_ecue_fin_ult1','ind_fond_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_hip_fin_ult1','ind_plan_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_pres_fin_ult1','ind_reca_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_tjcr_fin_ult1','ind_valo_fin_ult1',\n               'ind_viv_fin_ult1','ind_nomina_ult1',\n               'ind_nom_pens_ult1','ind_recibo_ult1']\n\ndef getTarget(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to fetch the target columns as a list\n    \"\"\"\n    tlist = []\n    for col in target_cols:\n        if row[col].strip() in ['', 'NA']:\n            target = 0\n        else:\n            target = int(float(row[col]))\n        tlist.append(target)\n    return tlist\n\ndata_path = \"../input/\"\ntrain_file = open(data_path+\"train_ver2.csv\")\n\ncust_dict = {}\ncust_count = 0\nmap_count = 0\nfor row in csv.DictReader(train_file):\n    cust_id = int(row['ncodpers'])\n    date = row['fecha_dato']\n    \n    if date != '2016-05-28':\n        cust_dict[cust_id] = getTarget(row)  \n    elif date == '2016-05-28':\n        new_products = getTarget(row)\n        existing_products = cust_dict.get(cust_id, [0]*24)\n        num_new_products = sum([max(x1 - x2,0) for (x1, x2) in zip(new_products, existing_products)])\n        if num_new_products >= 1:\n            map_count += 1\n        cust_count += 1\nprint(\"Number of customers in May 2016 : \",cust_count)\nprint(\"Number of customers with new products in May 2016 : \",map_count)\n\ntrain_file.close()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0be19ed9-5c23-dc0a-2fad-035a652f869a"},"source":"Though there were **931453 customers in May 2016, only 29712 of them got new products in that month**.\n\nConsidering we are predicting all these new products correctly, we will get a MAP@7 score of"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c22a9abe-4b2e-de2b-2185-9e5776348a20"},"outputs":[],"source":"print(\"Max possible MAP@7 score for May 2016: \",29712./931453.)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2cd4e8ef-3394-823b-85f9-841ed191b9f3"},"source":"Wow.! It is **0.0319 for May 2016** and I think that it will be around the same number for June 2016 as well. \n\nI did the same for other months as well and the maximum possible scores for other months are as follows:\n\n1. Apr 2016 - 0.0309\n2. Mar 2016 - 0.0330\n3. Feb 2016 - 0.0422\n4. Jan 2016 - 0.0330\n5. Dec 2015 - 0.0406\n6. Nov 2015 - 0.0404\n7.

Thanks to him and the scores are:\n\n1. ind_cco_fin_ult1 - 0.0096681\n\n2. ind_recibo_ult1  - 0.0086845\n\n3. ind_tjcr_fin_ult1  - 0.0041178\n\n4. ind_reca_fin_ult1  - 0.0032092\n\n5. ind_nom_pens_ult1  - 0.0021801\n\n6. ind_nomina_ult1  - 0.0021478\n\n7. ind_ecue_fin_ult1  - 0.0019961\n\n8. cno  - 0.0017839\n\n9. ctma  - 0.0004488\n\n10. valo  - 0.000278\n\n11. ctop  - 0.0001949\n\n12. ctpp  - 0.0001142\n\n13. fond  - 0.000104\n\n14. ctju  - 0.0000502\n\n15. hip  - 0.0000161\n\n16. plan  - 0.0000126\n\n17. pres  - 0.0000054\n\n18. cder  - 0.000009\n\n19. viv  - 0\n\n20. deco  - 0\n\n21. deme  - 0\n\nThe last 3 will most probably be 0 as well. \n\nSo summing them all, we get a score of **0.0350207** for the month of June 2016.\n\n**Inference:**\n\nFrom the script, we see that the maximum possible score varies between 0.0309 to 0.0543 for the previous months.\n\nFrom the Public LB probing, the maximum possible score is  ~0.0350207\n\n**So if the distribution of private LB is same as that of public LB, then we expect the maximum possible score to be around 0.035**\n\nHappy Kaggling.!\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/forums/t/25727/question-about-map-7"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
