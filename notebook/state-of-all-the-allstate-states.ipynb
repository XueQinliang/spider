Anyway, onward I go...\n\nThis gives clear statistical significance to the hypothesis. I apologize @dmi3kno and retract my retraction ;) I don't use R (another on my list of things to work on... currently trying to wrap my head around time series to fully grasp your other transformations), so I didn't quite realize that you were taking A-Y,AA-AY,BA and mapping to alphabetical state abbreviation until my prior test was questioned (always welcome). When I realized that, I think I found that state name ordering is the key here. I could be wrong because the code was not on the notebook, but it looked by the plot on the bottom of the notebook that it was ordered by alphabetical abbreviation.\n\nHere is what I tried in this third (and hopefully final) iteration:\n\nI ordered the states both by name first and by abbreviation second and used a permutation test to see if a random permutation of populations could compete. I assumed that it was random and checked if other random shuffling could produce the same chi^2 result over lots of different iterations. The p-values represent the percentage of how often the chi^2 result was lower."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ea105710-1a66-8ead-ccb9-257bd844ea16"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport
