Support Vector Machine\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) constructs a __hyperplane__ (or a set of hyperplanes in higher dimensional space) in the feature space, that could separate objects into classes. A good hyperplane is the one that has the largest distance to the nearest training data-point of any class. Those nearest training data points are called __Support Vectors__ :"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f8c4798f36dab67fd7239addee828af3a3266720"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://anniepyim.github.io/kaggle_images/SVM_1.png\" style=\"width:310px;\">\n<caption><center>Examples of hyperplanes<br>H1 is not a good hyperplane as it doesn't separate the classes<br>H2 does but only with small margin<br>H3 separates them with maximum margin (distance)<br>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)</center></caption>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"f86571607ac3adc0f29f0b31a1e2c013a6a7ee69"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport numpy as np","execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"13d810d327b0ad79ee48a31f4a232035f6b838dc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Parameters of SVM\n\nThere are three main parameters which we could play with when constructing a SVM classifier:\n- Type of kernel\n- Gamma value\n- C value\n\nTo better illustrate how the parameters could affect the outcome of the classifier, we use only 2 of the input attributes, so we could visualize the results on a figure."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6918a98ba68f0c88839a8a3faecd89364493aab5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X,y = iris.iloc[:,1:3], pd.factorize(iris['Species'])[0]\n\n# Define the boundaries for the graphs we will draw later\nx_min, x_max = X.iloc[:,0].min() - 1, X.iloc[:,0].max() + 1\ny_min, y_max = X.iloc[:,1].min() - 1, X.iloc[:,1].max() + 1\nh = (x_max / x_min)/100\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, h),\n np.arange(y_min, y_max, h))","execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"40cd6b462a8a764d90fb586e941b418720a737c9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Defining a function that declare a SVM classifier, with different parameters, and make predictions\ndef make_mesh(kerneltype, Cval, gammaval=\"auto\"):\n    svc = SVC(kernel=kerneltype, C=Cval,gamma=gammaval)\n    svc.fit(X, y)\n    Z = svc.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])\n    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)\n    return (Z)","execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8b349d0c3557235de4e23d5bc102452b3f13e6ea"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Type of kernel\nIt could be either \"linear\", \"poly\" (polynomial), \"sigmoid\", etc. The one below is \"linear\", and as its name says, the hyperplanes will be linear."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1f3cbf0f197c4b2f4452104e2f9eb76fa68f7e6b","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Z = make_mesh(\"linear\", 1, gammaval=\"auto\")\nplt.subplot(1, 1, 1)\nplt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.8)\n\nplt.scatter(X.iloc[:,0], X.iloc[:,1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm,s=20, edgecolors='k')\nplt.xlabel('Sepal length')\nplt.ylabel('Sepal width')\nplt.xlim(xx.min(), xx.max())\nplt.title('SVC with linear kernel')","execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a6b6713c23edbe44a73fd563b580663379eb6edc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The hyperplanes could be of course non-linear, if other types of kernels are used.
