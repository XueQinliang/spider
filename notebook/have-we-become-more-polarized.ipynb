This was also referred to as tribalism - an environment where political ideology is mostly influenced by identity. Such a tribal environment often leads to the creation of parallel bubbles - two camps which are geographically segregated.\n\nIn terms of popular vote, the 2016 elections were closer than the 2012 elections. But does it mean that more Americans live in proximity to people who voted differently? State-level results may be misleading. One might think, for instance, that in Pennsylvania we can find a lot of neighboring Republicans and Democrats, given how close the election results were in this state. County level results, however, tell a different story.
