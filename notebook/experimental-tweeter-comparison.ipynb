The goal is to demonstrate three different classification tools and determine who tweets more like Kim Kardashian, Adam Savage or Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nThe overall findings that are suggested by running the three classifications (though be it on a limited number of sets) and examining the jaccard score, the brier loss score, and the matthews coefficient indicates that Adam Savage tweets more like Kim Kardashian than Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nThe libraries chosen for classification are Passive Aggressive, Ridge, and Linear SVC. All perform well and are remarkably fast for how accurate they are on just a few hundred tweets from each person.\n\nAn advantage that Passive Aggressive classifiers have over Ridge and Linear SVC is the ability to do partial fits, which takes previous models and allows you to update them. This batch processing can be extended to fit an entire corpus of text rather than through individual testing.\n\n:: Future kernels will feature this and scaling capability ::\n\nBut to feed the machine properly, I've found in my own testing that the Robust Scaler tends to be the most effective at giving the classifiers good data.\n\nJaccard similarity score will be used instead of accuracy or f1 as several papers have indicated it is better for testing textual similarity than either f1 or accuracy.\n\nLater, I'll construct a matthews coefficient scorer from a confusion matrix which in playing on a larger scale, yields greater sensitivity to differences between authors.\n\nFinally, I'll include a brier score to determine not just the binary outcomes of predictions, but also as a way to measure the strength of the predictor."},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"5841748add93dcde73d6d37387ac02675f657c1c","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"e0ccd456-0446-bcff-ab5c-de4761a2a5b1"},"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"75f676ea957a1d6c6f54dbb3991d91ebf68ddf24","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"c514e8ee-1136-dbfe-c49f-35d755ca0483"},"source":"from sklearn.linear_model import PassiveAggressiveClassifier, RidgeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import jaccard_similarity_score, make_scorer, brier_score_loss, confusion_matrix\n\nimport nltk\nimport re\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom collections import defaultdict, namedtuple\nimport seaborn as sns"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"d2149ee5d1914c2403450fd0d51beec95ee16814","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"ad9e8a65-7e21-0739-d35d-b09c88c77914"},"source":"## Load Datasets\n\ndf_kim = pd.read_csv(\"../input/KimKardashianTweets.csv\")\ndf_neil = pd.read_csv(\"../input/NeildeGrasseTysonTweets.csv\")\ndf_fte = pd.read_csv(\"../input/FiveThirtyEightTweets.csv\")\ndf_adam = pd.read_csv(\"../input/AdamSavageTweets.csv\")"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d2911a6f32768eaaeab578693671dc7e05c8047d","_cell_guid":"7e3203df-0b42-80a2-533f-f7a26f6347bd"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"source":"Data cleaning require removing URLs, though because of the language of twitter, I will only remove the hashtag.\n\nPopular removals include pic.twitter, t.co, instagr.am, and https?

These are, but are not limited to, LinearSVC, PassiveAggressive, RidgeClassifier, Perceptron.\n\nIt is important to note that SVC's linear kernel does predict_proba when probability is enabled.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe set up to this might seem a bit strange at first. After all, why not just count up what's confused and what's correctly predicted from the main run? For starters, it enables much better scores and more precise scores. Second, by making predictions based only on two datasets instead of 4 while using the generalized model, it more accurately approximates human perception of text where we use our own generalized models which then cross-compare two sets of tweets to sort them into similar piles.\n\n*However* this can lead to implicit biases in the general model by overloading it with too many sets of tweets that are highly similar and one that is not. It is very recommended to amend the class to include a fifth \"noise\" dataset which could take anything, like the KDNuggets dataset, as input.\n\nThere are three kinds of scores: jaccard (which I highly suggest reading the wikipedia page on), brier loss, and the matthews coefficient.\n\nThe way that all these scores are set up is \n\n### Interpretation\nJaccard coefficient in the SKLearn package means that the higher it is, the more accurate/less similar two texts are and can range from 0 to 1.\n\nIn a similar vein, the geometric scorer, the matthews coefficient, is also where the higher means more dissimilarity and lower means more similarity. It ranges from -1 to 1. The other advantage that the matthews coefficient has is that it scales well. So rather than weighting a harmonic mean like f1 according to various sample size differences, it scales automatically while retaining a fair amount of sensitivity.\n\nThis is important if one wishes to increase the noise in the sample, has mismatched datasets, or wants to build different kinds of models with lopsided sample sizes.\n\nFinally, the Brier score is one that takes into account the strength of the prediction and can vary between 0 and 1. It is the square of the difference between perfect prediction and the strength of each prediction. So a score of 0, since it is a difference measure, means that it has 100% strength behind each prediction, while 0 means it has no strength behind each prediction.\n\nBetween the three measures above, iterated tests over multiple n-gram ranges is more easily evaluated too.\n# Control / Experimental design\nFor true comparison of who tweets more like whom, you take two at a time as primary and contrast and the target is the obvious target.

In both these cases, especially in the Linear SVC case, we find the \"hump\" of similar tweets, but also an overall trend toward similarity.\n\nA good addition to this notebook would be to create a method to directly calculate the brier loss score of just the tweets between the target and the interested text."},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"96650813e201027872d7aceb3c9b9480a258a39b","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"96795c93-05f0-4c58-3f31-db3f1180fa8b"},"source":""}],"nbformat_minor":0,"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.1","name":"python","file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}}}}
