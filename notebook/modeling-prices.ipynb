Right away we see a variable that doesn't matter at all: `host_listings_count` and `host_total_listings_count` (which are really almost one variable, it turns out!).\n\n   Note that `host_listing_count` *does* have an impact, in the case of professional BnB companies, that effect however is more readily explained by a second-order variable that we will examine later on.\n2. According to our model, every additional bedroom you want to rent will set you back an additional 35 dollars, while each additional bathroom will cost 11 dollars extra.\n\n   Considering that this is the core product, these are surprisingly low numbers! In other words, a disproportionate amount of price variation relative to our expectations is explained by factors other than the number of rooms available.\n\n   Here's a logical rationalization: renters going through AirBnB by and large are people looking for a relatively cheap short-term place to stay, and place less emphasis on the number of rooms available where they are staying than the convenience of and amenities available there.\n\n   This opinion contrasts with the way that hotel pricing generally works. Hotels charge multiplier premiums for additional rooms!\n3. Each additional bed is just 3 dollars extra, and each additional accomodation and guest included costs 6. Note that usually hosts charge extra fees for additional guests, a fee that has not been factored into our simply model, so this variable doesn't *really* capture the cost of bringing your friends. Still, these very low numbers hint that splitting a BnB is very cost-efficient.\n4. Surprisingly, the number of reviews *decreases* price. This isn't a huge effect, just 20 cents a review, literal peanuts price-wise. I interpret the smallness of this effect as meaning that we've done a good job getting rid of outliers: specifically, unrealistically high BnB prices meant to be jokes or set by scalpers, which would obviously *not* have any reviews.\n5. A host's review rating doesn't matter at all (at least, not for the price they charge).

Again, 40 dollars a night over the average seems like the premium you pay to be \"right there\" location-wise.\n\nAnd South Boston, a once working-class neighborhood now long and deep on gentrification, is the average-most of the nabes.\n\nOverall the range in the price premiums per choice of neighborhood can almost make up the average price alone! Put another way, every night in the Bay Village is *almost* two nights in Roslindale, on average.\n\nNext, let's look at amenities."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a15e4b01-6bef-4c7f-b2be-bed014af206e"},"outputs":[],"source":"amenity_effects = [v for v in coefs if v[1] in amenities]"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"29585a10-eb33-ac14-b770-79316eca9e0b"},"outputs":[],"source":"pd.Series(data=[n[0] for n in amenity_effects],\n          index=[n[1] for n in amenity_effects])\\\n    .sort_values()\\\n    .plot(kind='bar')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"66907325-e411-912e-4c31-f8b5fd642e43"},"source":"Amenities are an interesting case. \n\nOn a face level, more amenities is always better: every additional amenity available at a location will theoretically be a big plus for people who actually want it and a not-negative for those who don't (you can choose, after all, whether or not they make use of it). Hence on an individual level there's an incentive for a host to list irons, hot tubs, kitchens, the works.\n\nOn the level of AirBnBs at large, however, what a host chooses to list as an amenity is a signal about the \"class\" of the listing. The most obvious example of this to me is hangers. I do not doubt for a second that every (well, almost every) BnB on the market gives its visitors access to hangers, but it's available to list as an amenity all the same. Even when you don't list hangers, then, it's just *assumed* that you have them; hosts who choose to list them as a \"feature\" anyway bring up the shade of not having such a rather basic necessity, which actually signals a *lower* price.\n\nSo the effect of amenities in our model should be interpreted not as a fungible good but as a *social signal*. From that perspective, a price penalty for including a kitchen, hangers, or Internet access makes sense, with the magnitude of the effect corresponding with the strength of what that signals about the \"class\" of the rental.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's my observations:\n\n1. Other pet(s) and Washer / Dryer only appear in a very small number of listings, for whatever reason (perhaps this option has been disabled for new listings for a long time now?), and can safely be disregarded.\n2. A kitchen, free street parking, paid parking off premises, hangers, and Internet are all \"essentials\", and willingness to advertise them as amenities corresponds with a counter-intuitive and significant *decrease* in price.\n3. Having a pool is seemingly also penalized, which seems strange. But remember that pools are exceedingly rare inside of city limits; correspondingly having a pool signals that the unit in question is somewhere suburban far from the city center, a fact which seemingly overwhelms the positive benefit of having a pool at all. Note that this effect is also partially/mostly explained by neighborhood!\n\n   Free Parking on Premises nets a minor penalty for the same reason.\n4. Having a cat invokes a small price penalty, while having a dog basically doesn't change the price you can charge. Strangely, though, claiming instead that \"pets live on this property\" corresponds with a small cost bump. Of all of the effects this is the one I understand worst.\n5. Reasonable people don't need 24-hour check-in, apparently; nor do they need smoking rights.\n6. An entire range of goods&mdash;dryers, hair blowers, irons, first aid kits&mdash;have no significant effect on price.\n7. Being wheelchair accessible is a big bonus, presumably because it's still a rare thing and an indicator of a building being of recent build and relatively affluent.\n8. Breakfast service will set you back about ten bucks!\n9. An indoor fireplace and a doorman are both pretty obvious social signals, and each will set you back about 20 dollars a night.\n10. If you're a lister, apparently three easy things you *can* do to increase the price you can charge is provide a washer, A/C, and a TV. The former two cost 10 dollars a night (don't most places have A/C?), while the latter is a whopping 15 dollar a night premium.\n11. Having access to a gym nets a bonus, but a small one.
