The education space is full of non-profits like ours with limited resources. So the research question is, given limited resources, where (at which schools) can you target your intervention efforts to make an impact on those participation numbers. The hypothesis is that using what we know about students/schools who do take the test, we can find similar students/schools and rank them on their likelihood/opportunity of converting into test-takers.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: right\">  Max B, Dataset Creator </div>\n\n\n\n*Submissions for the Main Prize Track will be judged based on the following general criteria:*\n* Performance - How well does the solution match schools and the needs of students to PASSNYC services? PASSNYC will not be able to live test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it is effective at tackling the problem.\n* Influential - The PASSNYC team wants to put the winning submissions to work quickly. Therefore a good entry will be easy to understand and will enable PASSNYC to convince stakeholders where services are needed the most.\n* Shareable - PASSNYC works with over 60 partner organizations to offer services such as test preparation, tutoring, mentoring, extracurricular programs, educational consultants, community and student groups, trade associations, and more. Winning submissions will be able to provide convincing insights to a wide subset of these organizations. \n\n![ds for good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InFoCusp/kaggle_images/master/image1.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"72286eed900e64ed8a2ab804fe463af607e45690"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Organisation of this notebook:\n\nWe address the above requirements with the following analysis/ outcomes:\n* [Data gathering/ preprocessing (cleaning & aligning together)](#1)\n* [Data Augmentation with relevant fields derived from raw data](#2)\n* [Identifying schools with low number of test takers and large number of high performing underrepresented (Black and Hispanic) students in grades 7 and 8 ](#3)\n* [Linking schools to test prep centers](#4)\n* [Analysing schools with high Economic Need Index](#5)\n* [Analysing and mapping Schools based on School Performance Index](#6)\n* [Analysis of school safety](#7)\n* [Classification of schools based on Percentage of English Language Learners](#8)\n* [Summary](#9)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"206c942d4b0f216305cd79f253155c4dde91dc9e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3><a id=\"1\">Data gathering/ preprocessing </a></h3>\n\n<h4> Datasets we have used</h4>\n1. ***School Explorer*** (internal): provided by PASSNYC.\n1. ***NY 2010 - 2016 School Safety Report*** (Socrata's NYC Open Data): reporting crimes in localities of different schools.\n1. ***NY 2010-2011 Class Size - School-level detail*** (Socrata's NYC Open Data): School wise data of number of students and teachers per grade.\n1. ***Admission data ***(external): Loading this information is very crucial to understand SHSAT admissions, registrations and offers in schools across NYC State.\n1. ***PASSNYC resource centers data*** (external): Resource centers information we scraped from PASSNYC site with address, and they have also been categorized based on the services they provided. \n1.  ***8 Elite high schools data*** (external): school names and locations\n \n<h4> Pre-processing steps </h4>\n1.

However, we have registrations/offers data for 2017-18. So, the grade 6-7 students in the school dataset would be reflected in grade 7-8 of the registrations dataset. We searched for the 2016-17 registrations/offers data in order to do the analysis in sync with the 2016 school dataset. However, we were unable to find any such dataset online. So, we moved forward with the data at hand. The schools dataset, if availale for current years, can be updated in the analysis. \n\nBelow, we present the summary of our findings: \n\n1. **Recommendations for Schools with high performing students** [schools with (low number of registrations + high minority students + high minority students performing well (based on ELA and MATH 4s))] - which should be targetted for SHSAT preparations/ increasing number of registrations.\nWe also present proof that if these schools are targetted, it would lead to increase in the number of offers, thus increasing diversity of students enrolled in the elite schools.\n\n2. **Mapping of the above schools to PASSNYC help centers.**\n    \n   The help centers are categorized into 4 major categories : \n        Test preparation centers\n        After School centers\n        Economic help centers\n        Employment assistance centers (Also prevent students from engaging in criminal activities)\n\n    As the students of grade 8 & 9 are eligible for the exam, we have mapped the schools with high percentage of minority students whose performance is good (based on MATH and ELA in Grade 7 & 8) to test preparation centers of PASSNYC partners.  \n\n    Similarly, for schools where students of Grade 5 & 6 who perform well and have high percentage of minority students are mapped to PASSNYC offering after school program centers. \n    \n3. **Recommendations for Low performing schools on the basis of SPI - a combination of school performance parameters and Economic Need Index (ENI)**. <br>\nThese schools should be targetted an overall performance improvement over a longer run. If these schools are targetted, their performance could be improved which will result into increased number of registrations for SHSAT. PASSNYC should also setup SHSAT awareness programs in order to motivate the students and school in general, which definitely leads to increase in registrations. We have not mapped these schools with the 28 economic help centers of PASSNYC because financial aid can be provided from anywhere.\n\n4. **Mapping of the PASSNYC help centers has been done in two ways **: \n    \n    We mapped schools in need of PASSNYC services to the closest PASSNYC resource center and made clusters (based on colors as seen above). Using this technique, they can reach out to majority of schools quickly and with less burden. The goal was to reach out to majority of schools with minimum resources.\n\n    During EDA, we had found ideal locations for centrally located help centers which could serve multiple schools. However, we came across the already present help centers of PASSNYC partners and found that most of them were overlapping with our suggested locations. One additional location has been suggested by us, which can be setup as per the requirements of PASSNYC contributors."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"7e8d7e13230f37ef8b4d877a32498a2c8638a33a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
