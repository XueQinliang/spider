The most noticeable effect was seen in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, 3 states that went red for the first time since 1988. but the general shift towards republicans can also be seen in Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota and more Midwest to Northeast states.\n\nBut the shift itself doesn't necessarily mean that Obama voters voted for Trump. It's possible that Obama voters didn't turnout on election day, allowing a republican take-over.\n\nThis is what I am intending to explore in this script. In the counties that were flipped by Republicans - was it Trump outperforming Romney, possibly reaching out to Obama voters, or maybe Clinton under performing Obama, not being able to mobilize her potential supporters to vote?"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6331950e-45f1-c2d1-3820-f2560ad1cf02"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3f81a833-f936-73a0-a678-a3b9d7e798f4"},"outputs":[],"source":"%matplotlib inline"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a1c81fdf-0025-e668-02c9-a73b0350d1ff"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Read Data\nvotes = pd.read_csv('../input/votes.csv')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3334bf91-4e2c-b096-f6ed-070275590b07"},"outputs":[],"source":"for i,row in enumerate(votes.iterrows()):\n    if row[1].votes_gop_2016>row[1].votes_dem_2016:\n        votes.loc[i,'winner_16'] = 'Trump'\n    else:\n        votes.loc[i,'winner_16'] = 'Clinton'  \n    if row[1].votes_gop_2012>row[1].votes_dem_2012:\n        votes.loc[i,'winner_12'] = 'Romney'\n    else:\n        votes.loc[i,'winner_12'] = 'Obama' "},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7f77cae3-6db0-8717-e1be-3a1cac7be34f"},"source":"## Let us only take into account Trump-flipped counties:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5ba24bde-a5f5-d4f6-d31f-2ca89f1d31b5"},"outputs":[],"source":"flipped = votes[votes.winner_16 == 'Trump']\nflipped = flipped[flipped.winner_12 == 'Obama']"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8cc212f5-7472-03ea-0562-e27fd8804a7c"},"source":"we also need to account for population growth.

I have chosen the county level due to the relative homogeneity of a county, compared to a state. when looking in the state level at a state like, say, Pennsylvania, which is huge and diverse, it is very difficult to determine whether a vote shift it due to a real voters shift or merely a turnout shift  "}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
